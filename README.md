# needle-tracker
A place to keep track of all the knitting needles you've got scattered around your house so you can finally get down 
to business and finish the hat you promised your sister back in February. 

##### Requirements:
NPM  
Node.js  
MongoDB

##### To run:

1. Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/acuyjet/needle-tracker.git

2. Move into the needle-tracker directory:

        cd needle-tracker
    
3. Start MongoDB:

4. In a new command line tab, start the app:
    
        npm start

5. Open a browser window and go to `localhost:3000`.

##### Issues to address:
* Change text box inputs back to dropdown selectors and figure out how to get them to work well with Angular
* Add sorting and filtering
* UI improvements
